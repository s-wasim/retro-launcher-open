/**
 * Enumerates launchable apps, sorts by label, and assigns each one a
 * category — auto from {@code ApplicationInfo.category} (§9 delta 3),
 * overridden by whatever the user has assigned through the drawer's category
 * sheet.
 *
 * <p><b>V9 §11.</b> This used to enumerate through
 * {@code PackageManager#queryIntentActivities}, which only ever returns
 * activities in the <em>calling user's own profile</em>. OEM clones — Samsung
 * Dual Messenger, Xiaomi Dual Apps, OnePlus Parallel Apps — live in a
 * secondary user profile, so that call could not see them: the drawer was
 * never deduplicating clones away, it had simply never been shown them.
 * {@link LauncherApps#getActivityList} asked once per profile is the call
 * that can. It has been available since API 21 against a {@code minSdk} of
 * 26 and needs no new permission, which is why it does not undo §10's
 * permission reduction — in particular it does not need
 * {@code QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES}, which this app does not declare and must not.
 *
 * <p>{@code getUserProfiles()} returns every profile associated with this
 * user, so a work profile's apps arrive here too and are badged the same way
 * a clone is. That is the right outcome for a launcher — a work app the user
 * could not reach at all is worse than one marked with a star — and it is the
 * same launch path either way.
 *
 * <p>Some locked-down OEM builds restrict profile enumeration. Every failure
 * here falls back to the old {@code queryIntentActivities} path, because the
 * failure mode that matters is not "no clones" — it is an empty drawer.
 *
 * <p><b>2.1.3: the result is cached.</b> {@link #load()} is a Binder round
 * trip per user profile, a {@code loadLabel} per activity — another Binder
 * call each, and on a device with three hundred apps that is three hundred of
 * them — a {@code Prefs} read, and a sort. It was being run from
 * {@code DrawerPanel.refresh()} on <em>every</em> {@code onResume}, from
 * {@code SearchOverlay.open()} on every long-press, and again to populate the
 * dock picker, all on the UI thread, all returning the same list. Pressing
 * Home therefore paid for a full re-enumeration before the drawer could
 * settle.
 *
 * <p>The cache is held until something that could change the answer happens,
 * and {@link #invalidate()} is the single door: a package installed or
 * removed, or a category assignment edited. Nothing else can alter what this
 * returns, so nothing else needs to drop it. Getting that wrong shows up as a
 * newly installed app missing from the drawer, which is why the invalidation
 * points are few and named.

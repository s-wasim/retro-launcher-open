/**
 * Holds the four panels at fixed offsets and moves them with the finger.
 *
 * Navigation model, ported from the prototype's onDown/onMove/onUp — see
 * DESIGN_NOTES §1:
 *   - no axis is chosen until the finger travels 12dp; the larger of |dx|/|dy|
 *     wins and is locked for the rest of the gesture
 *   - panels track 1:1 while dragging, then settle over 260ms
 *   - a gesture starting inside the system gesture inset is left to Android
 *   - a gesture over a no-swipe subtree is left to that subtree, on the axes
 *     that subtree claims
 *
 * A panel closes with the reverse of the swipe that opened it, and that has to
 * work from anywhere on the panel, including on top of its list. So no-swipe
 * ownership is per-axis rather than per-subtree: a vertical list owns vertical
 * drags and lets sideways ones through to close the panel, and it owns a
 * vertical drag only while it still has somewhere to scroll — at the top of
 * its travel a downward drag belongs to the panel, which is how the screen
 * time panel is pulled shut. See {@link #setNoSwipe(View, int)}.
 *
 * Animation discipline (each rule exists because breaking it is visible):
 *   1. Exactly one writer owns a panel's translation at a time. A running
 *      settle animator owns it; onLayout and drag() must yield to it or cancel
 *      it, never write underneath it.
 *   2. Only panels that actually move are animated at all.
 *   3. A panel is VISIBLE only while on-screen or moving. Off-screen panels
 *      are opaque and full-screen; leaving them VISIBLE is pure waste.
 *   4. No hardware layers. A translation-only animation over an unchanging
 *      subtree is a transform on an already-recorded display list — the
 *      RenderThread composites it for free. withLayer() cannot make that
 *      cheaper, and it costs a full-screen offscreen texture allocated on the
 *      first frame of every slide, which is what made panels blink.

/**
 * Every app icon in the launcher, as pixel art, in three stages evaluated per
 * app:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Hand-drawn mark.</b> {@link PixelGlyphs} — 16x16, palette-role
 *       coloured. Big-name apps keep their crafted marks.</li>
 *   <li><b>Converted real icon.</b> The app's own icon rendered at 24x24 and
 *       quantized through the palette's ramp with the shared Bayer bias, so
 *       icons and wallpaper speak one colour language. Upscaled
 *       nearest-neighbour, which is what keeps it pixel art rather than a
 *       blurry small icon.</li>
 *   <li><b>Letter tile.</b> Only when the app genuinely has no icon.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p><b>2.1.2 — what each stage costs, and therefore what is cached where.</b>
 * The three stages are nothing like each other in price, so they are not
 * cached alike:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Stage 1</b> is a few dozen {@code drawRect} calls against a 16x16
 *       grid, with no {@code PackageManager} round-trip. Re-rendering it is
 *       cheaper than decoding a PNG of it, so it is held in memory and never
 *       written to disk — which is the "when a mark is available, nothing
 *       happens" case.</li>
 *   <li><b>Stage 2</b> is the expensive one: a drawable load across a Binder
 *       call, an adaptive-icon crop, 576 nearest-ramp lookups and a scale.
 *       Memory <em>and</em> disk, kept for the life of the install and
 *       dropped only when that package changes.</li>
 *   <li><b>Stage 3</b> is cheap to draw but is only reached after stage 2 has
 *       already paid its full cost to discover there was no usable icon — the
 *       drawable load and the blank test are the price of getting here at
 *       all. Caching it is therefore caching that failed lookup, which is the
 *       point. Memory and disk.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Stages 1 and 2 are cached at their own source resolution — 16x16 and
 * 24x24 — and upscaled by the returned {@link BitmapDrawable} with filtering
 * off, at 1/29th of the memory. Stage 2 is pixel-for-pixel identical to what
 * it produced before: {@code createScaledBitmap(…, false)} is itself a
 * filterless matrix scale, so moving it from eager to draw-time changes when
 * it happens and not what it computes. Stage 1 is a grid rather than a
 * rescale — it used to round each run's edges to device pixels itself, and
 * now lets the same nearest-neighbour upscale do it — so a cell boundary can
 * land one device pixel either side of where it used to at sizes that are not
 * a whole multiple of 16. Same cells, same colours, same hard edges. Stage 3
 * is antialiased text and cannot be reconstructed from a smaller copy at all,
 * so it alone is still rendered and cached per size.
 *
 * <p>This replaces the {@code GeneratedTileIcons} / {@code PosterizedIcons}
 * either-or, which was wired behind a debug flag and made the two mutually
 * exclusive — so a hand-drawn mark and a converted real icon could never
 * appear in the same drawer. They are stages of one chain, not rivals.

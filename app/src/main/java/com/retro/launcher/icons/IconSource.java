 * How an app becomes something an {@code ImageView} can draw. One
 * implementation, {@link PixelArtIcons}. The seam stays because the drawer,
 * the dock and the search overlay all draw through it, and swapping the
 * implementation for a measurement or an experiment should not touch any of
 * them — 2.4.1 removed the measuring wrapper that used to be the second
 * implementation, since nothing had wired it since 2.1.3.
 *
 * <p><b>2.1.2: a Drawable, not a Bitmap.</b> This returned a Bitmap already
 * scaled to {@code sizePx}, which meant the cache had to hold one upscaled
 * copy per size per app — see {@link IconCache} for what that cost. It now
 * returns a drawable wrapping the icon at its own small source resolution,
 * with filtering off, so the ImageView performs the nearest-neighbour upscale
 * at draw time for free. {@code sizePx} is still passed because stage 3, the
 * letter tile, genuinely renders differently at different sizes.

/**
 * Turns an {@link AppActionPolicy.Action} into intents and fires them through
 * {@link Launch#first}.
 *
 * <p>The bug that produced this class: the drawer fired a bare
 * {@code ACTION_DELETE} inside {@code catch (ActivityNotFoundException
 * ignored) {}}, and on a device without
 * {@code android.permission.REQUEST_DELETE_PACKAGES} declared, that call
 * <em>succeeds</em>. The system's PackageInstallerActivity resolves, starts,
 * checks the caller for the permission, fails to find it, and finishes before
 * drawing a single pixel. Nothing throws, so the catch never runs, and from
 * the device the row simply does nothing at all. The permission is declared in
 * the manifest now; the chains below are the insurance for a device that fails
 * some other way, and every failure is logged and reported rather than
 * swallowed.

/**
 * The connected {@link AccessibilityService} the launcher performs global
 * actions through: opening the notification shade (DESIGN_NOTES §9 delta 21)
 * and locking the screen (delta 25).
 *
 * <p>The name is narrower than the job. It stays that way deliberately: the
 * enabled-services setting stores this class's flattened component name, so
 * renaming the class would silently switch the service off for everyone who
 * had already enabled it.
 *
 * <p>Opening the shade is why it was written, and that half is unchanged —
 * the notes below are about it.
 *
 * <p>The documented-looking route, reflecting into
 * {@code StatusBarManager#expandNotificationsPanel()}, is a non-SDK interface
 * on the denylist. At this app's targetSdk the reflective lookup throws
 * outright, which is why the swipe used to be a silent no-op: the call failed
 * and the catch-all swallowed it. It still works on older and on some OEM
 * builds, so {@code HomeActivity} tries it first and only falls back here.
 *
 * <p>This service reads nothing. It declares no
 * {@code canRetrieveWindowContent}, requests the narrowest event type the
 * framework will accept, and never looks at the events it receives — its
 * entire purpose is to be a live {@link AccessibilityService} instance that
 * {@link #performGlobalAction} can be called on. It is opt-in: until the user
 * enables it from Settings the fallback simply reports failure and the swipe
 * stays inert.

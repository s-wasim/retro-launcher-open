# How the APK gets built

There is no Gradle wrapper in this repo, so the Gradle and AGP versions are
pinned in two places that must move together: `gradle-version` in
`.github/workflows/build.yml` and the AGP version in the root
`build.gradle`. CI is the reference build environment. Here's the path from
"design applied" to "APK on your phone."

## 1. Trigger

A push to any branch fires `.github/workflows/build.yml` automatically. It
can also be run manually with `gh workflow run build.yml`.

## 2. What CI does

1. Checks out the repo on a fresh `ubuntu-latest` runner.
2. Installs JDK 17 (Temurin) and Gradle 8.14.5 — no wrapper needed, since
   the workflow installs Gradle directly via `gradle/actions/setup-gradle`.
   That version is the floor for AGP 8.13.2, which is what compiles against
   `compileSdk 36`; changing either means changing both.
3. Runs `gradle assembleDebug --no-daemon`.
   - `minifyEnabled true` + `shrinkResources true` + R8 full mode strip
     unused code/resources on this build type (debug is intentionally
     shrunk too, since it's the one that gets sideloaded).
   - `app/build.gradle` declares exactly three dependencies — Shizuku's
     `api` and `provider`, plus the `androidx.annotation` they require. Any
     fourth is a change to HANDOFF.md §1, not a routine addition.
4. Prints the resulting APK's size with `ls -lh`, so every run's log states
   the number against budget (debug < 150 KB, release < 80 KB).
5. Publishes `app-debug.apk` as a **GitHub release asset** (via `gh
   release create`, tagged `build-<run-number>`) — not a workflow artifact,
   because artifacts download as a ZIP and Android can't install that
   directly; a release asset is a tappable `.apk` URL.

## 3. Getting the APK onto a phone

```bash
gh release download build-<run-number> --pattern '*.apk'
```

Transfer it to the phone (`adb install app-debug.apk`, or any file-transfer
method) and install it — "install unknown apps" needs to be allowed for
whatever app opens it, since this doesn't go through the Play Store. Then
set it as the default home app: **Settings → Apps → Default apps → Home
app**.

## 4. If a build fails or blows the size budget

The workflow doesn't enforce the size budget automatically — check the
"Report APK size" step's log against the numbers in `HANDOFF.md` §1
yourself. If a change pushed it over budget, that's a signal to revert or
rework the change rather than raise the budget.

## Versioning and signing

Two things have to stay true or sideloaded updates stop installing, and the
failure looks identical in both cases: "App not installed", with no further
detail.

**`versionCode` is computed, not literal.** `app/build.gradle` derives it from
`GITHUB_RUN_NUMBER + 1000`. CI's run number only ever increases, so every
published build outranks the last. Do not replace this with a literal — a
frozen `versionCode` means the package manager sees every build as the same
version and refuses the install.

**`app/debug.keystore` is committed on purpose.** Android refuses an update
whose signing certificate does not match the installed app's. Without a
committed keystore, each `ubuntu-latest` runner generates its own
`~/.gradle/debug.keystore`, so no two CI builds share a signature. The file
holds the platform's well-known debug credentials — alias `androiddebugkey`,
store and key password `android` — which is a published key pair by design and
carries no security value. Since 3.0.0 only `debug` points at it: `release`
is signed with your Play **upload key**, supplied through GitHub Secrets and
never committed, and CI builds the signed `app-release.aab` only when those
secrets exist. See `PUBLISHING.md` steps 3–4.

**One-time step after upgrading from a pre-V7 build:** the previously installed
launcher was signed with a runner-generated key that no longer exists.
Uninstall it once before installing the first V7 APK. Every build after that
updates cleanly.

**CI verifies the signer on every run.** `app/expected-signer.txt` holds the
one fingerprint every build must carry. The "Verify signer" step in
`.github/workflows/build.yml` runs `apksigner verify --print-certs` on the
freshly built APK and fails the build if the digest does not match — this is
the check whose absence let three months of unsignable releases ship before
V8. If it fails, the keystore or signing config changed; that is a stop,
not a fingerprint to update casually.

**Every push, on every branch, now builds.** The workflow used to trigger
only on `main` and `V7`; a push to any other branch produced no APK and no
signal that CI even ran. It now triggers on `branches: ['**']`.

**Diagnosing a failed update:** compare the release notes' signer line
against the device's installed signer with
`adb shell dumpsys package com.retro.launcher | grep -A2 signatures`.

# Minimal Retro Launcher

A native Android home-screen launcher: four swipe-navigable panels, an
animated per-pixel sky wallpaper, live weather, and screen-time limits. Java
only, no Kotlin source, no Compose, no Material, no `RecyclerView`. `minSdk 26`,
`targetSdk 36`. 3.0.1 is a performance pass: no freeze on returning home, and
the theme follows the sky the moment the launcher is back in front. 3.0.2 makes
screen time agree with Digital Wellbeing: time spent on a second screen of the
same app is no longer lost, and the home screen counts.

This is the open-source edition. The nine paid features of the Play build
(palettes, light/dark, wallpaper tint, second time zone, custom date format,
haptic feedback, screen-time lockdown, custom wallpaper and manual wallpaper)
are still shown in Settings, behind a `<PAID>` banner, but their
implementation is not part of this source: tapping one only says so. There is
no billing code and no in-app purchase.

  amendment to them, which the source comments cite by section.
- [`design/DESIGN_NOTES.md`](design/DESIGN_NOTES.md) — the prototype-to-native
  token audit, the sky renderer's layers, and the §9 delta list.
- [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) — how the APK is built, signed and published.
- [`PUBLISHING.md`](PUBLISHING.md) — the Play Console steps, in order.
- [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) — the privacy policy Play requires, to host publicly.

```

Anything pure enough to test without an emulator lives in `:core`, which is a
plain `java-library`. `:app` is the only module that sees an Android type.

## Building

There is deliberately no Gradle wrapper committed (no `gradlew`, no
`gradle-wrapper.jar`) — CI installs Gradle directly via
`gradle/actions/setup-gradle`, and a binary wrapper JAR you did not watch
someone generate is a supply-chain smell. The versions are pinned in two
places that must move together: `gradle-version` in
`.github/workflows/build.yml` (8.14.5) and the AGP version in the root
`build.gradle` (8.13.2).

No local Android SDK is needed to work on this repo — CI is the reference
build environment. With a local Gradle 8.14.5+ and an Android SDK:

```bash
gradle :core:test        # unit tests, no SDK needed
gradle assembleDebug     # the APK
```

## Installing

Every push builds and publishes a signed debug APK as a GitHub release asset:

```bash
gh release download build-<run-number> --pattern '*.apk'
adb install app-debug.apk
```

Then set it as the home app: **Settings → Apps → Default apps → Home app**.
Read [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) before changing anything about signing or
`versionCode` — both have broken sideloaded updates before, and the failure
reads only as "App not installed".

/**
 * How often the sky is worth redrawing, given what is actually in it.
 *
 * <p>Until 2.1.3 {@code SkyView} ran a fixed ~30fps for as long as the
 * launcher was foreground: a 108x230 buffer, several full-buffer passes,
 * thirty times a second, forever. On a clear afternoon almost none of that
 * produced a different frame, so the cost was thirty CPU wake-ups a second to
 * redraw the same picture — which is the launcher's battery footprint
 * essentially in its entirety. Nothing about the renderer needed to change;
 * what it needed was to be asked less often.
 *
 * <p>The two rates are derived from the speeds the layers in
 * {@link SkyRenderer} actually move at, and the fastest layer present wins:
 *
 * <table>
 *   <caption>Measured layer speeds against the buffer</caption>
 *   <tr><th>Layer</th><th>Speed</th><th>At {@link #FAST_MS}</th>
 *       <th>At {@link #SLOW_MS}</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Rain</td><td>124–238 px/s</td><td>5–10 px/frame</td>
 *       <td>31–60 px/frame</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Snow</td><td>14–34 px/s</td><td>0.6–1.4 px/frame</td>
 *       <td>3.5–8.5 px/frame</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Cloud drift (calm)</td><td>0.3–0.9 px/s</td><td>0.01–0.04</td>
 *       <td>0.08–0.22 px/frame</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Star twinkle</td><td>3.7 s period</td><td>88 samples/cycle</td>
 *       <td>15 samples/cycle</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Sun ray pulse</td><td>3.9 s period, 4 integer lengths</td>
 *       <td>93</td><td>16 samples/cycle</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>Precipitation is the only thing that needs frames: a snowflake is one
 * pixel and at the slow rate it would jump several of its own widths, which
 * reads as a dotted trail rather than a fall. Everything else is far slower
 * than it looks. A cloud crosses a pixel roughly every two seconds, so
 * drawing it four times a second versus thirty produces the identical
 * sequence of frames — the step happens when the cloud crosses the pixel, not
 * when we ask. The twinkle and the ray pulse are the binding constraint on the
 * slow rate, and 15 samples a cycle is comfortably above where either starts
 * to step.
 *
 * <p>So there is no middle tier: a scene either has precipitation in it or it
 * does not. An earlier cut of this class had one for clouds, on the assumption
 * that visible drift needed more than 4fps. The numbers above say it does not.
 *
 * <p>Every threshold here mirrors the gate its layer applies in
 * {@link SkyRenderer#render}, so the two cannot drift apart without a test
 * failing. That coupling is the point: a budget that disagreed with the
 * renderer about whether a layer is drawn is how you get frozen rain.

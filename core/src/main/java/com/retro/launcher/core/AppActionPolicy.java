/**
 * Which rows the drawer's long-press quick-action box offers for a given app.
 *
 * <p>This exists because the box used to offer one row labelled
 * "UNINSTALL / DISABLE", and a launcher can only ever do one of those two
 * things. It cannot disable anything —
 * {@code PackageManager#setApplicationEnabledSetting} is reserved for the
 * device owner and for an app acting on itself — and it cannot uninstall a
 * preinstalled app at all. So the row promised whichever outcome the user
 * happened to want, and on a preinstalled app it delivered neither.
 *
 * <p>What the launcher can honestly offer depends on two
 * {@code ApplicationInfo} flags, and that decision is the part worth testing
 * off-device, so it lives here rather than inside a view:
 *
 * <table>
 *   <tr><th>App kind</th><th>Removal rows</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>User-installed</td><td>{@code UNINSTALL}</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Updated system app</td><td>{@code UNINSTALL_UPDATES}, {@code DISABLE}</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>Preinstalled, not updated</td><td>{@code DISABLE}</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>This launcher</td><td>none</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>An OEM clone (V9 §11)</td><td>none</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>The clone row is there for the same reason as the rest of this class:
 * an honest row only. A clone lives in another user profile, and every
 * removal intent a launcher can fire is scoped to its own — so UNINSTALL on
 * a clone would not remove the clone, it would offer to remove the original
 * app the user still wants. Neither the platform nor this app has a way to
 * remove a clone; the OEM's own Dual Apps settings screen does, and that is
 * not somewhere a launcher can deep-link to portably.
 *
 * <p>{@link Action#LAUNCH} and {@link Action#APP_INFO} are offered for every
 * app including this one; the table governs the removal rows only.
 * {@link Action#DISABLE} is a deep link to the system App Info page, where the
 * platform's own Disable button lives — the launcher points at it rather than
 * pretending to be it.
